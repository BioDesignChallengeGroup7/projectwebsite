                        <h2>Why Kombucha?</h2>

                        <p>Kombucha is a fermented tea made from black tea and sugar. While the tea is fermenting into Kombucha, a layer of pellicle grows on the surface. The Kombucha acts as a food media for the pellicle to grow. As long as the Kombucha is kept undisturbed at room temperature and there is no presences of harmful bacteria such as mold, the pellicle can grow well. The pellicle is made of many fine strands of bacteria cellulose all intertwined together. This layer of pellicle is of high interest since itâ€™s crystallinity and tensile strength is much higher than plant cellulose, which is already strong. Because of this, there is a lot of potential for the use the bacteria cellulose as an alternative material to traditional textiles, both naturally sourced and synthetic, and even plastics. In comparison to many of these traditional materials, bacterial cellulose is more biodegradable. It has a life cycle that allows it to be broken down and reused by natural systems, so if bacterial cellulose can successfully be used as an alternative, it can help reduce the amount of waste that is unable to be recycled back into the natural ecosystem.</p>

                        <p>For the purposes of our project, biocellulose made by the SCOBY (the colonies of bacteria and yeast that are associated with kombucha production) is of interest because of its ability to act as growth media in biofiltration. We needed to use a material that was able to act like a textile (which growth media like woodchips was unable to do) while still being an ideal home for the bacteria to grow on (unlike synthetic fabrics).</p>
