                        <p>Poor indoor air quality has detrimental effects on human health, particularly in the modern era where the average person spends 90% of their time indoors. Along with this issue is the occurrence of sick-building syndrome, which is caused by a number of combined aesthetic and technical building conditions. The combination of visibly poor working environments and the presence of harmful particulates makes factory workers especially at risk to the symptoms of sick-building syndrome and thus a decreased quality of life due to health issues.</p>

                        <p>BacterFilter addresses these problems by integrating biofiltration into a decorative panel. BacterFilter focuses on the filtration and degradation of the chemical 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) in order to help lower levels of this toxin in factories that manufacture vinyl, which is commonly used in interior finishes and furniture. BacterFilter fights design with design in order to improve the working conditions of factory workers.</p>

                        <p>The bacteria <em>Xanthobacter autotrophicus</em> uses the pellicle as a growth media to integrate its ability to degrade DCE with the visual possibilities of the cellulose. The features of the bacterial cellulose wall panel are estimated to decrease the effects of sick-building syndrome, and they have a more sustainable life cycle in comparison to traditional commercial wall panels and panels.</p>

                        <p>While BacterFilter currently focuses on removing DCE from at risk environments, further development of the product could lead to the ability to integrate other toxin degrading microorganisms into the panel. This will allow BacterFilter to address the air quality needs of a variety of other environments.</p>
