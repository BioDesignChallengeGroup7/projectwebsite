                        <p>Our product uses biofiltration to degrade 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE) into glycolate. Dichloroethane is a volatile organic compound, meaning that it easily diffuses into the air. It is heavily manufactured to make vinyl chloride monomers (VCM), which are used to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This makes humans who work in settings that manufacture products using vinyl compounds especially at risk for the effects of DCE exposure. Upon exposure, dichloroethane has known neuropsychological effects such as lower neuropsychological functioning in the domains of processing speed, attention, cognitive flexibility, motor coordination and speed, verbal memory, verbal fluency, and visuo-spatial abilities. It has also been shown to lead to disturbed mood, impaired vision, depression, nausea and vomiting, eye problems, respiratory distress, gastritis, colitis, and hepatocellular and renal changes. Circulatory and respiratory failure from inhalation or ingestion of the chemical has resulted in death in humans. </p>

                        <p>Biofiltration is a biological air treatments that is commonly used.  It utilizes medium containing degradative microorganisms to remove or degrade gaseous contaminants in the air.  A variety of substances can be used as biofilter media. Soil, composted wood chips or bark, peat, synthetic media such as activated carbon, porous ceramics, and even plastics can be used for biofiltration.   Our study chose bacterial cellulose because it is able to maintain its moisture and provide necessary minerals for bacteria. </p>

                        <p>The product filters air by passive transport.  As air flows through the kombucha containing Xanthobacter autotrophicus, 1,2-Dichloroethane is lagged behind and either removed or broken down by the Xanthobacter microbial colonies inside the medium.  The enzymes within Xanthobacter autotrophicus catalyzes the oxidation of DCE; 2-chloroethanol is produced as an intermediate.  The intermediate is then further oxidized into chloroacetaldehyde, a useful intermediate for many pharmaceutical compounds.  Chloroacetaldehyde can be further oxidized and produce chloroacetic acid.  At the end of oxidation reaction, glycolate, a colorless and odorless salt thatâ€™s often used in skin products, is produced.</p>
