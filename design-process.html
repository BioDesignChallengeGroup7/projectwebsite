                        <h2>Design Process</h2>

                        <h3>Research Phase</h3>
                        <p><b>Market Needs:</b> 1,2-Dichloroethane is heavily produced in the U.S. for vinyl. Since it is highly volatile, the workers who work in vinyl production are at high risks of breathing the toxic chemical into their body. In addition, the environment and water sources at high risk of contamination. To prevent the escape of 1,2-Dichloroethane into the human body and into the environment, the use of a biofiltration system is necessary to convert the 1,2-dichloroethane in the air into less harmful products.</p>

                        <p><b>Biofiltration:</b> When exploring different possibilities, we focused on looking for a filtration method that is sustainable and environmental friendly. Eventually, we decided to look into biofiltration--a biological air treatment that’s commonly use in industries.  Biofiltration uses minimal amount of energy since the air is filtered by passive diffusion, and the medium used in biofiltration are decomposable. </p>

                        <p><b>Xanthobacter autotrophicus:</b> Xanthobacter autotrophicus was chosen as a candidate of interest since it possesses the ability to carry out a series of reactions that can convert 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE) into glycolate. First, Dichloroethane is converted to Chloroethanol, which is then converted to Chloroaldehyde. Next, Chloroaldehyde is converted to Chloroacetic acid. Finally, Chloroacetic acid is converted to the end product, Glycolate, which is a very unreactive and low health hazard compound.</p>

                        <h3>Prototyping</h3>

                        <p><b>Growing Xanthobacter autotrophicus:</b> In order to grow the bacteria strain of interest, special nutrient agar was made from DI water, beef extract, peptone, and agar. The nutrient agar was autoclaved to sterilize it to get rid of any bacteria that may interfere with the growth of the target bacteria strain. In addition, a flame was set up before the agar was poured into the petri dishes to make the environment as sterile as possible.</p>

                        <p><b>Growing Cellulose:</b> Kombucha tea media was made using black tea, sugar, and hot water in a tub with a lot of surface area. Starter tea and a small piece of pellicle was added to the media in order to speed up the pellicle growing process. The tea was left to ferment in order to produce Kombucha tea and to produce more pellicle. In order for the pellicle to grow well, the pellicle was left undisturbed throughout the growing process.</p>

                        <p><b>Purifying Cellulose:</b>The fresh grown kombucha medium naturally emits an unpleasant smell.  To eliminate the smell of the SCOBY, we obtained pellicles that had been pre-soaked in NaOH. At this point, the smell was partially eliminated.  To neutralize the pellicle, we soaked it in water before being soaked in an acidic bath of 5M hydrochloric acid.  After the acid bath, the pellicle was then rinsed in deionized water and soaked for 24 hours.  Few drops of NaOH was added into the water bath to reach a pH of 7.  The pellicle was left to sit for 24 hours before it was removed from the bath, lightly rinsed, and left to dry in a room temperature environment. While drying, the pellicle was massaged once per day. </p>
                        <p>After the pellicle was neutralized and dried, the pure cellulose showed a pure white color with the texture of thin layers of plastic. The odor is completely eliminated; the washed pellicle is now odorless and colorless. </p>

                        <p><b>Growing Cellulose in Citrus:</b> To experiment growing bacteria cellulose on a sustainable media, we worked with another group of students to grow bacterial cellulose in a mixture of black tea and citrus juice.   After citrus waste was collected from the residential area in Davis, it was sliced and juiced.  Then the collected juice was distributed in three rectangular boxes and mixed with black tea, sugar, and ethanol to create a mixture.  A piece of SCOBY was then added to the mixture as a starter of the bacterial cellulose.  After the SCOBY was added, the starter was left to sit for two weeks in a room temperature.  </p>

                        <p>The pellicle in citrus media was growing at a higher rate than ordinary kombucha media.  We removed one of the pellicle after a week of waiting. The pellicle was almost fully grown, with numerous small bumps on the surface.  The pellicle growing in citrus media was then removed from the media and left to dry in a room temperature environment.  Compared to the dried bacterial cellulose we collected previously, the dried citrus pellicle was softer and more flexible.</p>

                        <p><b>Panel Prototyping:</b> After we obtained the pellicle, we stretched it on an embroidery hoop that has a diameter of 8 ¾ inches.  The pellicle is then placed on a flat surface and left to dry at room temperature.  The wet pellicle dried within 5 hours, resulting in a layer that was relatively thin and smooth in comparison to the pellicles that were laid on a flat surface to dry. Blue food dye was applied to the dried pellicle. After the applied dye dried, a small amount of pressure was applied, which broke the pellicle. It did not pass the pressure test.</p>
